## Components

Each component should include a story called `<Component />` which is fully interactive and instrumented with knobs, but which includes no wrappers or boilerplate.

Each component should also include a story called `Example`, which describes the use of the component with relevant, embedded examples.

`<Component />` and `Example` pages should be linked. If a component has controlled and uncontrolled versions, those should also have cross-links.
