# ExpansionPanel.Header

By default, its children will be vertically centered and justified between. If an `expandIcon` is passed, it will be placed at the end and will be animated by rotating it 180 degrees when `expanded` prop is set to `true`.

If you want to have more control over the rendered component, you can pass `chidren` as a render prop that receives the expand icon as argument. Check the _Examples_ section.
