# Media Object

The `<Media>` Dark Matter object is a useful tool to create consistent layout behavior. It originally came about from Nicole Sullivan's use of Object-Oriented CSS to cleanup media object display on Facebook. [Here is her original article with classic float-based CSS](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/)

This took hold as a standard pattern and appeared in frameworks such as Bootstrap and Foundation.
