# \<Kite\>

**A configurable Kite component that automatically triggers onClose when the time to live interval elapses**

This component can be used as a toast that slides in from the top left to display information.

Below is an example structure of the `<Kite>`

```
<Kite>
  <Kite.KiteIcon/> (optional)
</Modal>
```

This will render a Kite with an icon.
