# \<Avatar\>

Avatar is used for a circular image (usually in relation to a Noun). Often paired with words, but this component is standalone with no additional margins.

### Sizing

You may pass a size (`small`, `medium`, `large`) or a number, which will be the width and height in pixels.

### Display

- If an imageUrl is present, it will display in the circle.
- If no imageUrl but a name is present, the first two initials will display in the circle with a blue background
- If loading is true, it will show a blue background with a shimmer animation
