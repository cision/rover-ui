# \<Avatar.Addon\>

Avatar Addon is used as a position block within the avatar. Any node can be wrapped with `Avatar.Addon`, although it will not be useful unless the child of `Avatar`.

Position options are:
`top-left`
`top-right`
`bottom-left`
`bottom-right`

### Offsets

If an offset is set on an Addon, it will move that amount toward the center of the parent Avatar. (Eg. to move it further from the center give it a negative offset).
