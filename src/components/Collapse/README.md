# \<Collapse\>

The `Collapse` component is a wrapper of `Transition` component from [react-transition-group](http://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group) that keeps track of children's `height` and animates it when it is opened or closed through `isOpen` prop.

You can also pass [Transition props](https://reactcommunity.org/react-transition-group/transition#Transition-props).
