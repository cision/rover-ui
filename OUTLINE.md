# Introduction
TK-UI is a collection UI components that define TrendKite's design language. These components should help you build applications in React that look and feel right.

## Installation

To install and develop or run locally, you're in the right place.

## Development

### What to avoid in TK-UI
It's _not_ a repository for all of TrendKite's shared components. Don't try to add components that deal specifically with TrendKite business logic and concepts here. Don't try to add components that handle whole layout areas.
