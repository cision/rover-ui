# Example App

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)._

This app exists to test importing components from the local development copy of RoverUI.

```bash
// cd to RoverUI's root directory
yarn build
cd example
yarn
yarn start
```

That should start a local webserver hosting the example React app, which is a simple container for importing RoverUI's various components for testing.
